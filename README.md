OYLO *Heb for Oh No

My personal playground with YOLO based networks. I'm interested in segmentation and super resolution. YOLO impressed me with its speed and its creator with his writing and insights. What can go wrong?

Quick TODO list:
1) Prepare list of references
2) Update YOLACT model with recent YOLO changes
3) Write a summary of everything YOLO related


Why do I want it? My hardware is old, I want an efficient network that can run quickly on it and possibly on cell phones.
